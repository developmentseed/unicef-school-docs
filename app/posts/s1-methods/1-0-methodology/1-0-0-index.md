Our workflow of school detection with DG Vivid imagery and machine learning can be simplified as a diagram as follows. The diagram of our school detection system with high-resolution satellite imagery and machine learning. The Core Machine Learning Model and model inference sit at the center of the diagram. To its left is the pipeline for cleaning, validating and generating the training dataset, and to its right is the machine learning prediction and validation.

Our AI-assist school detection in Colombia and the East Caribbean islands are:
- Data cleaning
- Training data creation
- Sat-Xception and the school classifier
- The model inference with the best performed model over Colombia and the eastern Caribbean islands
- The expert mapper validate the machine learning prediction

See the detailed steps under this section.
