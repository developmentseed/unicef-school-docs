Our workflow of school detection with DG Vivid imagery and machine learning can be simplified as a diagram as follows (see at the executive summary [section](link?)). In the following content, we will go through each section of the diagram specifically.

The diagram of our school detection with high-resolution satellite imagery and machine learning. The Core Machine Learning Model and model inference sit at the center of the diagram. To its left was our training dataset cleaning and generation pipeline, and to its right was our machine learning prediction and validation.

Specifically, the AI-assist school detection in Colombia and the eastern Caribbean islands are:
- Data cleaning
- Training data creation
- School detection machine learning core model with Sat-Xception
- The model inference with the best performed model over Colombia and the eastern Caribbean islands
- The expert mapper validate the machine learning prediction

See the detailed steps under this section.
