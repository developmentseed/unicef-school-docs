Our workflow of school detection with DG Vivid imagery and machine learning can be simplified as a diagram as follows. In the following content, we will go through each section of the diagram specifically.

<Figure caption> The diagram of our school detection with high-resolution satellite imagery and machine learning. The Core Machine Learning Model and model inference sit at the center of the diagram. To its left was our training dataset cleaning and generation pipeline, and to its right was our machine learning prediction and validation.
